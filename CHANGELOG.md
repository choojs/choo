## `3.3.0`
Yay, `plugins` now support `wrappers` which is a segway onto HMR, time travel
and other cool plugins. These changes have come through in barracks `v8.3.0`
and a lil fix in `v8.3.1`. This is a lil patch before `4.0.0` comes through,
but should be super valuable. Wooh!

### changes
- updated barracks to `v8.3.1`

## `3.2.0`
Wooh, `plugins` are a first class citizen now thanks to the `.use()` API. It's
a multiplexed version of the old `app = choo(hooks)`. It should enable
attaching multiple hooks onto the same API, which is useful to create re-usable
extensions to `choo`. They should be used with care though, and be as generic
as possible, but the docs should provide enough backdrop for that. Anyway,
have fun with plugins! :tada:

### changes
- added `app.use()`

## `3.1.0`
And another patch down. This time around it's mostly maintenance and a bit of
perf:
- The addition of the [nanoraf](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanoraf)
  dependency prevents bursts of DOM updates thrashing application performance,
  quite possibly making choo amongst the fastest frameworks out there.
- We now ship standalone `UMD` bundles on each release, available through
  [https://npmcdn.com/choo](https://npmcdn.com/choo). The goal of this is to
  support sites like codepen and the like; __this should not be used for
  production__.

## `3.0.0`
Woooh, happy third birthday `choo` - _thanks dad_. You're all grown up now;
look at how far you've come in the last month. You've grown... tinier? But yet
you do more? I love you `choo` - _shut up dad_.

### Notable changes
#### Who's the tiniest of them all?
`choo` is now `5kb` optimized! That's `2kb` less compared to v2. _Woah, how?_
We now support [yo-yoify](https://github.com/shama/yo-yoify) which optimizes
those lil template tags to `document.createElement()` calls. So not only is it
smaller, creating elements now has no overhead. Pretty nifty eh? Mad shoutout
to [Shama](http://twitter.com/shamakry) for building this!

#### Captain Hook(s)
V3 introduces `hooks` - powerful functions that are called at certain points in
the refresh cycle. Unlike functions in `models` these functions have unfiltered
access to all properties, call stacks and more. They're super useful when
building error handling, logging or persisting for stuff like `hot reloading`.
I quite like them, and I'm def keen to see what uses people will come up with!

#### Effect Composition :train::train::train::train:
`effects` are now composable by calling a `done(err, res)` callback when
they're done executing. This means that multiple namespaced effects can be
chained together to form some higher level behavior.

Think of cases like "logout" - multiple models must be cleared, perhaps tokens
invalidated on the server, all in a certain order. This requires multiple
models to work in tandem. - And now that's possible! :sparkles:

#### Pathfinders guide
We've started work on the [choo
handbook](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo-handbook) - a lil manual to help
you get started, not only with choo, but with web development in general. It's
super modest still, only containing a single `choo` tutorial, but we'll be
expanding this over the coming months. If you want to contribute some docs,
there's [a whole section of
ideas](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo-handbook/issues/10) on stuff that
might be neat to write. Any lil bits are welcome! Shout out to
[Tim](https://twitter.com/timwis) for making this happen :tada:

#### The Cycle of Life
`views` have gone through a bit of a change - they're now required using
`require('choo/html')` so they can be factored out of a project into standalone
[bel](https://github.com/shama/bel) components at any time. But additionally
these components have gained super powers through the adition of `onload` and
`onunload` hooks. Components can now react to being mounted or not, which makes
them ideal to implement standalone widgets. This behavior uses [html5
MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
under the hood, so it will work anywhere with a DOM!  Again, this was all
[Shama](http://twitter.com/shamakry)'s hard work.

#### Test coverage
`choo` has gained a beaut blanket of tests, courtesy of
[Todd](https://twitter.com/whale_eat_squid) and
[Ben](https://twitter.com/bendrucker/). We've got server, browser and
_pretty-much-all-browsers-known-to-mankind_ style testing which should give us
a pretty good idea if stuff breaks. Neat!

#### Core dump
Internally we've moved the core of `choo` into a separate package -
[barracks](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/barracks). `choo` is now mere glue
code around `barracks`, `yo-yo` and `sheet-router`. This is good news for folks
who like `choo`, but don't agree with all decisions. Go forth and build your
own lil framework!

### Changelog
